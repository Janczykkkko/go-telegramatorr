# go-telegramatorr

Simple bot (in development) for my particular use.

Currently has two functions:
1. getting current sessions from Jellyfin, as a response to comand /jellystatus in telegram. This returns some information about the currently running streams (filename, subtitle filename, bitrate, username).

    >Example:  
    >Here's an activity report from Jellyfin:  
    USER is playing (in progress): Agatha Christie's Poirot - S10E01 - Mystery of the Blue Train Bluray-1080p h265 AC3 2.0  
    Playback: Transcode  
    Bitrate: 4.43 Mbps  
    Subtitles: English - SUBRIP - External  
    Device: USERâ€™s MacBook Pro



2. botMonitor, which tracks user sessions (every 30s) and reports on them in the chat when they finish, providing duration and what was played. Restarting zeroes all session information. Sessions older than 3hrs are automatically purged.

    >Example:  
    User USER was playing Good People for 1 minutes - finished.

Requires 3 env vars:  
TELEGRAM_APIKEY,  
and (to enable Jellyfin gatherer)  
JELLYFIN_APIKEY,  
JELLYFIN_ADDRESS  
and/or (to enable Plex gatherer)  
PLEX_ADDRESS  
PLEX_APIKEY  
and (to enable botMonitor)  
TELEGRAM_CHATID 


Still a work in progress - sometimes subtitles aren't correct, there are some inconsistencies in outputs.
